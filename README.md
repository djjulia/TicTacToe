Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. It allows two players to take turns marking the cells in a 3x3 grid, with the objective of achieving three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

Roadmap to Future Improvements
Highlight Winning Squares: Implement a feature to highlight the winning combination of squares upon victory. This could involve visually emphasizing these squares by changing their background color or adding a border.

Undo Last Move: Add functionality to undo the last move made by a player. This would require maintaining a move history in the game state and allowing players to revert to the previous state by removing the last move from the history array.

These improvements would enhance the user experience and add more interactive features to the game.
